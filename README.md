Reflection (Using STAR Technique):

Situation: During our second-year group project, we needed to delegate research tasks and consolidate our findings into a single presentation. Miscommunication initially led to some team members working on overlapping sections.

Task: My role was to establish clear communication channels and ensure everyone understood their specific responsibilities and deadlines.

Action: I initiated a team meeting on Microsoft Teams to clarify the project scope. I then created a shared document outlining each section, the assigned owner, and the deadline for drafts. I also set up a dedicated channel for quick questions and updates, sending a follow-up email summarizing the agreed-upon plan.

Result: This structured approach eliminated task duplication. The team was more focused and coordinated, leading to a cohesive final presentation that was delivered on time and received positive feedback from our lecturer. I learned that proactive and clear business communication is crucial for team efficiency.

## 2. Interview Skills

Reflection (Using STAR Technique):

Situation: I was preparing for a mock interview for a hypothetical Junior Support Specialist role. I knew I had the technical knowledge but was nervous about articulating my experiences effectively.

Task: My goal was to present my skills and past experiences in a structured, confident manner that directly related to the job requirements.

Action: I researched the company and the role thoroughly. I practiced using the STAR technique to frame my answers, focusing on a specific instance where I troubleshooted a software issue for a classmate. I recorded myself answering questions to review my body language and clarity of speech.

Result: During the mock interview, I was able to answer questions confidently without rambling. The interviewer specifically complimented the structure of my answers, noting they were clear and demonstrated relevant problem-solving skills. This exercise built my confidence and showed me the power of preparation and structured storytelling.

## 3. Mock Interview
Evidence:

Mock Artefact: A link to a 5-minute video recording of my mock interview. (Note: For the portfolio, you could upload a unlisted YouTube/Vimeo video or a video file to your repo). [Example: Mock_Interview_Video.mp4]

Mock Artefact: The feedback form received from the mock interviewer. [Example: Mock_Interview_Feedback_Form.pdf]

Reflection (Using STAR Technique):

Situation: I participated in a recorded mock interview session organized by the faculty, simulating a real-world job interview for a graduate program.

Task: The objective was to apply my prepared interview skills under pressure, receive constructive criticism, and identify areas for improvement.

Action: I dressed professionally and treated the session as a real interview. I actively listened to each question, paused to think, and responded using the STAR framework. I also engaged with the interviewer by asking my prepared questions at the end.

Result: The feedback highlighted my good preparation and technical knowledge but pointed out that I spoke too quickly when nervous. Watching the recording was invaluable; I could see my own body language and identify moments where I could be more calm and deliberate. This was a critical learning experience in managing interview nerves.

## 4. Professional Networking
Evidence:

Reflection (Using STAR Technique):

Situation: I recognized that building a professional network is key to career growth in the ICT industry, but I started with zero connections outside of my immediate classmates.

Task: My goal was to create a professional online presence and begin building a network of peers and industry professionals.

Action: I created a complete and polished LinkedIn profile. I then connected with my lecturers, classmates, and alumni from CPUT. I followed leading tech companies and joined groups related to software development and IT support. I engaged with content by commenting thoughtfully on a post about cybersecurity trends.

Result: I have grown my network to over 50 relevant connections. A CPUT alumnus even messaged me with advice on preparing for the job market. This experience demystified professional networking and showed me it's about building genuine, professional relationships online.

## 5. Workplace Etiquette
Evidence:

Reflection (Using STAR Technique):

Situation: In a simulated project scenario, our team had to collaborate on a tight deadline. There was a disagreement between two members about the technical approach, which was causing tension and delaying progress.

Task: My task was to help mediate the situation respectfully and ensure the team maintained a professional and productive working environment.

Action: I requested a short break to allow everyone to cool down. I then facilitated a discussion where each person could state their viewpoint without interruption. I focused the conversation on the project's goal rather than personal opinions and suggested we list the pros and cons of each approach objectively.

Result: The team agreed on a hybrid approach that incorporated the best elements from both ideas. The conflict was resolved amicably, and we successfully met our deadline. This taught me that workplace etiquette isn't just about manners; it's about using emotional intelligence and professional conduct to navigate challenges and maintain team harmony.
